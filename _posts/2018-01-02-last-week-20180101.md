&nbsp;

Decembers tend to be my worst month of the year because a particular series of events happen and a certain set of memories come back each year. However, some amazing things have also developed this month, and so it deserves to be talked about.

# <del>Work</del> Interviews

There&#8217;s not much to say about work anymore, so I&#8217;m changing this section to Interviews. I decided that I&#8217;ll be public about my job search, but won&#8217;t mention the companies I talk to until after I&#8217;m hired.

  * I continue to get some great interviews. I had an on-site in Portland and in Seattle. Both wanted to be the same week (right after Thanksgiving) and after scheduling both, I realized flying to the city and back home only to try to fly back out was pretty ridiculous. But also it would have worked out that I would have had to change planes in the middle of the air. So I changed it to make it one giant trip. KC->Portland->Seattle->KC.  (Or, including layovers, KC->Denver->Portland->San Jose->Seattle->Salt Lake City->KC.) But it was good. But didn&#8217;t get either job (though the Portland one I was really close on, and would work there in a heartbeat if they asked me again).
  * I am schedule to go to an on-site in the Bay Area again. I sure do like it there, so I&#8217;m excited to go back.
  * I have been in talks with a company in Pittsburgh, and though details are still pending, it&#8217;s looking like they want to bring me on site too.
  * I have started talking to about 3 other companies and working with finding positions and scheduling interviews with them.

# Life

  * As I mentioned above, Decembers are a rough month. There&#8217;s a huge list of reasons, but some of the hardest involve memories of depression, feeling like each year I got older and had nothing accomplished with my life (though it&#8217;s a bit better now), and death of a friend and death of my &#8220;adopted mom&#8217;s&#8221; son many years ago. But I want to reclaim the month for good. I had this silly idea last year of wanting to have people mail me postcards, and decided to try it this year. I bought a PO Box for 3 months (the minimum you can get) and then&#8230; just published it on the internet. (I know, who does that?) And I was pleasantly surprised to get over 50 cards from all over the US and world! I was expecting mostly touristy cards, like pictures of the city people live in, but I was also pleasantly surprised at people&#8217;s creativity! I got some amazing postcards that made me smile, and they came at a good rate over the course of the whole month. It surprisingly worked amazingly well! I think I might a blog post more about my experiences with that.
  * While I went to Portland and Seattle for on-site job interviews, I did stay extra days to hang out with some great friends and play tourist. I had been to Portland the previous year for AlterConf Portland 2016, but Seattle was a first. In Portland, I got to reconnect with <a href="https://twitter.com/_sagesharp_/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sage</a> (and meet their partner <a href="https://twitter.com/jamey_sharp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jamey</a>), <a href="https://twitter.com/ameschright" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Audrey</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/undees" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Erin</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/lissmccabe" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Liss</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/_jokuge" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jay</a>, and then meet Twitter/Slack friends <a href="https://twitter.com/maventheavenger" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jamie</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/marginalchaos" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jesse</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/das_Rachaelchen" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rachael</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/cthos" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Alex</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/FeyNudibranch" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kara</a>. In Seattle, I got to meet Slack friends <a href="https://twitter.com/h_griswold" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Heather</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/depaysant" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AJ</a>, Twitter friend <a href="https://twitter.com/teaaddict13" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Erica</a>, and ran around and saw the touristy things. (The Space Needle is so cool!)
  * I got to sing in my second concert, <a href="http://www.kcwomenschorus.org/concerts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Curve of Time</a>, with the <a href="http://kcwomenschorus.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kansas City Women&#8217;s Chorus</a>. It was so fun and great to be around 80+ amazing women and be a part of something beautiful. We got to sing fun songs, thoughtful songs, powerful songs, and just plain beautiful songs. It&#8217;s also the first time I felt I finally had made some good friends in the group. When I started rehearsals for this in September, there were notes both higher and lower than my singing range, and by concert time I had managed to hit them. I also found I had to build more confidence singing independent of music or others around me as there were parts where I couldn&#8217;t hear other alto 2 people around me. Kinda scary for me, but I did it! (Check out <a href="https://www.facebook.com/doug.thomas.3701/videos/10215043872068212/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">one of our songs</a>, and this [great review](https://www.broadwayworld.com/kansas-city/article/BWW-Previews-KANSAS-CITY-WOMENS-CHORUS-PRESENTS-THE-CURVE-OF-TIME-at-The-Liberty-Performing-Arts-Theater-20171118)!)
  * I posted a <a href="https://twitter.com/geekygirlsarah/status/947565852995522562" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter thread</a> on how I worry about not feeling technical enough, especially lately given that I don&#8217;t really have much of a technical muse or much energy to trying to work on side projects, and chatting about day job-type work isn&#8217;t really anything worth talking about.

# Speaking/Talks

Invited

  * I mentioned last time being invited to Deliver:Agile 2018. I decided on a topic and the organizers like it. Hopefully it will go on the website soon.
  * I was invited to speak at DevFestMN, and am working with the organizers on selecting a topic.
  * I was invited to be the guest speaker for <a href="https://techtonica.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Techtonica</a>&#8216;s <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/2018-apprenticeship-launch-celebration-tickets-41595729948" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apprenticeship Launch Celebration</a>. I was asked to give an inspirational speech to the women and non-binary people going into the first code school session.

Podcasts

  * I was on <a href="https://hallwaychats.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hallway Chat</a>&#8216;s last episode of 2017, <a href="https://hallwaychats.com/episodes/episode-29-sarah-withee/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">episode #29</a>, and I chatted with hosts Liam and Tara about all sorts of different things. It was a great chat, and they must have loved having me because they <a href="https://twitter.com/HallwayChats/status/946380297549033472" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted &#8220;End your year on a high note: meet someone worth knowing.&#8221; </a>

#  Entertainment

  * I finished Angel! Finally got through all 12 seasons of the whole Buffy-Angel collection. Though I have to say&#8230;  WHAT WAS THAT ENDING!?!? Come on, that was a terrible ending for the show.
  * I wanted something light-hearted for the remainder of December, so I decided I never finished Community and I needed to. I started over from the beginning, and just started season 3 today (as of this writing).
  * I saw Star Wars: The Last Jedi in theaters. And spoiler alert: you see who the last Jedi is. But really I liked it. Would recommend.
  * I saw The Disaster Artist also. It was also great. I didn&#8217;t know about The Room (the movie this movie is about) or anything about the people that made it. I had heard this movie was funny but &#8220;funny&#8221; is a vast understatement. This movie is hilarious and ridiculous and I definitely had to cringe at some of the awkward situations.
  * I also saw Pitch Perfect 3. If you liked the first two (like I did), you&#8217;ll like the third. I think it pulled a few heartstrings as well because of my involvement with the women&#8217;s chorus, but also lots of talk in the movie about their futures and starting new chapters of their life, and I definitely felt those feels as well. I liked this movie as well.

Stay tuned for my year in review post and looking at next year. Until then&#8230;
