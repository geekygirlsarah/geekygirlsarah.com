# Life

  * I got to go on about the only trip I&#8217;m scheduled to go on this year. It was a trip to Detroit for Self.Conference, which was my favorite conference from last year. I love that it&#8217;s very tech-focused, but nearly every talk also includes a decent amount of empathy, and so did the hallway conversations. This year was no different. And I gave a talk (see below).
  * I&#8217;ve been at the new apartment for 3 months, and I&#8217;m starting to finally go through the pile of stuff in the living room. Trying to sell several things, give away others, trash others.
  * I announced The Rest of Us in Tech, the &#8220;secret project&#8221; I&#8217;ve been working on since December. The goal is to amplify the voices and stories of underrepresented people in tech. The first part of it is a podcast, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jejgz6txn8I" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the first episode</a> is on YouTube now. The near future will be on iTunes/Play Store/Microsoft Store.
  * &#8230; then I lost my voice from either being sick or a bad allergy attack. (Not sure which.) And I cancelled 3 interviews for the podcast because of it. It sort of bummed me out, but I&#8217;m slowly getting better. Hopefully can reschedule those this week. But nothing like releasing a new thing then not being able to do much work on it after that. Also it&#8217;s embarassing to go into the world with a barely-working voice.

# Work

  * I implemented several pieces of a larger chunk of the module rewrite. Mostly just making some forms and making sure they save with the correct other data.

# Entertainment

  * I completed Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess HD. I was trying to get through the Cave of Ordeals, a 50-floor cave where each floor gets just a little bit harder. The second-to-last floor killed me 3 times (and it&#8217;s a pain getting there). Finally beat it on the 4th try. Then did the final castle and beat the final boss the first time I tried. Who knows how that works. But another game in my attempt to play them all down. I probably won&#8217;t pick up the next one for a bit.
  * I started Buffy the Vampire Slayer, and am now up to part of season 4. It&#8217;s pretty good, if not super 90s. Lots of interesting nostalgic feels from my high school days too.
  * I&#8217;ve started catching up on SNL after seeing some funny skits referenced. And honestly, this year&#8217;s SNL season has been one of the funniest I&#8217;ve seen in a while. They&#8217;ve been on point (Melissa McCarthy&#8217;s portrayal of Sean Spicer) and the right amount of weird (backpack dance party) and just random hilarity (Chris Pine&#8217;s &#8220;Not That Chris&#8221; sung to Uptown Girl&#8217;s music about all the (Chris&#8217;s? Chris&#8217;? Chrises?) in the movie industry).
  * I also have been catching up on John Oliver&#8217;s Last Week Tonight. Youtube has about everything online. Besides being hilarious, it&#8217;s very well researched and always feels very enlightening, even when I know about the topic already. And I&#8217;m always impressed at what they can pull off in a week.

# Talks

  * I decided to cancel my talks in Code PaLOUsa, mostly due to financial reasons. I don&#8217;t have the funds or vacation time to make the conference work.
  * I did give my &#8220;Power of Secrets&#8221; talk at Self.Conference in Detroit. Interestingly, the room was about half full, and it grew to nearly full by the time I ended. Also interestingly, the Friday at 11 slot was all women speaking in every track. How awesome! (And another Sara spoke in the slot!) Perhaps the best comment was from [@daniel_davis](https://twitter.com/daniel_davis) who tweeted &#8220;You know it&#8217;s a powerful session when you bounce back and forth between laughing and crying. <a class="link-complex" href="https://twitter.com/geekygirlsarah/" target="_blank" rel="user noopener noreferrer" data-user-name="geekygirlsarah">@<span class="link-complex-target">geekygirlsarah</span></a> <a class="link-complex" href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23vulnerability" target="_blank" rel="hashtag noopener noreferrer"><span class="hash">#</span><span class="link-complex-target">vulnerability</span></a> <a class="link-complex" href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23selfconf" target="_blank" rel="hashtag noopener noreferrer"><span class="hash">#</span><span class="link-complex-target">selfconf</span></a>&#8221; [[Tweet link](https://twitter.com/daniel_davis/status/865590651831951361)]
  * I went to several good ones, and hope to have that written up in a post soon.

# On the Internet

  * [Space] There&#8217;s lots of buzz about Juno, NASA&#8217;s spacecraft that&#8217;s orbiting Jupiter right now. It&#8217;s made 6 passes around Jupiter so far, and there&#8217;s now reports from the first two rounds. Bad Astronomy posted &#8220;[We knew Jupiter was weird. Now we&#8217;re finding out HOW weird.](http://www.blastr.com/2017-5-29/we-knew-jupiter-was-weird-now-were-finding-out-how-weird)&#8220;, Gizmodo posted &#8220;[NASA&#8217;s Juno Mission Just Dropped Its First Huge Pile of Results](https://gizmodo.com/nasas-juno-mission-just-dropped-its-first-huge-pile-of-1795546707)&#8220;, and of course [NASA continues to post their own info](https://www.missionjuno.swri.edu/) (including the initial pics from the 6th pass now). Space never ceases to fascinate me.
  * [Funny] Alamo Drafthouse movie theater is having a showing of Wonder Woman, but only for people who identify as women. So a bunch of men got mad on social media, and [this post](https://www.upworthy.com/sexist-trolls-got-mad-about-an-all-women-wonder-woman-screening-the-theater-fired-back) shows how the theater brilliantly responded back.
  * [Electronics] This guy decided to [take a laptop from 1983 and make it work on today&#8217;s internet](https://gizmodo.com/surfing-the-internet-with-a-laptop-from-1983-sounds-nig-1723338928). And of course the thing is sloooooow.  But it&#8217;s amusing anyway.
  * [Silly] Rompers are in style for women, so this Kickstarter campaign started the [RompHim](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/106904571/the-romphimtm-your-new-favorite-summer-outfit/). A romper for men. And I&#8217;m equally laughing at it and thinking it&#8217;s kind of amazing at the same time.
  * I know there&#8217;s more great things but decided not to try to weed through my tweets as I&#8217;ve posted tons in the last little while.
