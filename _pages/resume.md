## Projects

**Code Thesaurus – [develop.codethesaur.us](https://develop.codethesaur.us)**

A polyglot developer reference tool to help you compare languages you know with ones you don’t for reference or learning. An open-source application that’s in progress and nearing an MVP.

**Rest of Us in Tech – [restofus.tech](https://restofus.tech)**

The Rest of Us in Tech is an inclusive initiative for the tech community which highlights projects and accomplishments of underrepresented people in tech. I’m the founder and host of the podcast, currently available on iTunes, Google Play, and most other podcast apps.

**Hardware Projects and Robotics**

I am presently mentoring a FIRST Robotics Challenge team of all girls based out of Carnegie Mellon University. In my past, I was involved in my university’s robotics competition team for several years. I also mentored other middle and high school FIRST robotics competition teams in my last city. (All teams won numerous awards and one middle school team went to the world championships.) I have continued to tinker with hardware projects on the side to this day, and make my code and diagrams available on GitHub.


## Speaking and Conferences

I love sharing what I learn with the developer communities as well as people interested in getting started programming. I have been speaking, teaching, and mentoring in many forms since 2011. Besides local classes and workshops, I have spoken and keynoted at over 60 events locally, nationally, and internationally. I have organized multiple events and conferences as well. All of my notes, videos, and slides can be found at geekygirlsarah.com/speaking .
